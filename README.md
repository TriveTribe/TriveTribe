## TriveTribe - A gamified platform for Ground Up Initiative
TriveTribe is a gamified platform that rewards users for their participation with Ground Up Initiative (GUI) events.

Through TriveTribe:

- Users can earn xp and level up by participating in GUI events ðŸ’° 
- Users can collect badges as they hit certain learning objectives set up GUI ðŸ“ˆ
- Users can RSVP for events with a click of a button ðŸ™‹

Additionally, 

- Admins can create events and manage users ðŸ“…
- Measure impact through xp earned and badges collected ðŸ“Š

## Motivations
We felt that the current system of tracking user participation in GUI events was not engaging enough. We wanted to create a platform that would encourage users to participate in events and reward them for their efforts, as well as provide insights on volunteers impact. We came up with a gamified platform that would reward users with xp and badges for their participation. Having badges given out for certain learning objectives, GUI would be able to study the volunteering preferences of their members and interests. Not only that, they would also be able to categorise their mmeber's impact on GUI's core organisational pillars. This would not only allow GUI to better understand their members, they can also use this data to improve their events and volunteer experience.

## Getting Started

- Use the demo account with the following credentials:
  - Username: `test@test.com`
  - Password: `password`
- Play around with the app and see how you can earn xp and badges!
- We welcome feedback, so feel free to create an issue [here](https://github.com/TriveTribe/TriveTribe/issues)

## Tech Stack
We used the following technologies to build TriveTribe:
- Next.js with Typescript and TailwindCSS
- Pocketbase, hosted on Pockethost (powered by SQLite)
- Vercel for CI/CD and deployment

## Future plans
- We plan to create more advance analytics with the data collected through TriveTribe, to provide GUI with more insights on their members in many creative yet robust ways.
- We also plan to add more features to the platform, such as a leaderboard and a more advanced badge system to future encourage volunteer participation.
- As TriveTribe is a gamified platform, we plan to add more game elements to make it more fun and engaging for users as they go through learning objectives set by GUI.
